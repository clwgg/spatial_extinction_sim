* Spatial Simulations with ~tspipe~
** Project Structure
- ~tspipe/~
  - library code for simulation pipeline
- ~application/~
  - application code for simulations, using tspipe
- ~slim/~
  - SLiM code, called from application code above
- ~analysis/~
  - downstream analysis code, to be run on finished simulations

** Initial Setup
~SLiM~ (version 4) will have to be downloaded and compiled in addition to the
setup of this python project, and supplied to the application code via the
~--SlimBin~ option.

*** Setup (using a python virtual environment)

In the cloned repository folder:

#+begin_src bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install .
#+end_src

** Spatial Extinction Workflow
- ~application/extinction_app.py~
  - simulation driver application
  - different parameter sets accessible through subcommands
  - see ~python application/extinction_app.py --help~
  - see parameter options with ~python application/extinction_app.py testing --help~
- ~slim/spatial_extinction.slim~
  - ~SLiM~ code for spatial extinction, called from ~application/~ code above
- ~analysis/spatial_stats.py~
  - script for spatial ~SampleSet~ analysis
  - run with base-name of ~finished~ tree sequence file

*** Run (with testing parameters)

In the cloned repository folder:

#+begin_src bash
  mkdir output
  python application/extinction_app.py testing
  python analysis/spatial_stats.py output/extinct
#+end_src
