* Spatial Simulations with ~tspipe~
** Project Structure
- ~tspipe/~
  - library code for simulation pipeline
- ~application/~
  - application code for simulations, using tspipe
- ~slim/~
  - SLiM code, called from application code above
- ~analysis/~
  - downstream analysis code, to be run on finished simulations

** Initial Setup
Note that this project currently utilizes beta versions of both ~SLiM~ (version
4.0) and ~pyslim~ (version 1.0).
~SLiM4~ will have to be downloaded and compiled in addition to the setup of this
python project, and supplied to the application code via the ~--SlimBin~ option.

*** Setup (using a python virtual environment)

In the cloned repository folder:

#+begin_src bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install .
#+end_src

** Spatial Extinction Workflow
- ~application/test_extinction.py~
  - simulation driver application to run with testing parameters
  - see CLI options with ~python application/test_extinction.py --help~
- ~application/prod_extinction.py~
  - simulation driver application to run with production parameters
- ~slim/spatial_extinction.slim~
  - ~SLiM~ code for spatial extinction, called from ~application/~ code above
- ~analysis/spatial_stats.py~
  - script for spatial ~SampleSet~ analysis
  - run with base-name of ~finished~ tree sequence file

*** Run (with testing parameters)

In the cloned repository folder:

#+begin_src bash
  mkdir output
  python application/test_extinction.py
  python analysis/spatial_stats.py output/TMP-FILE
#+end_src
